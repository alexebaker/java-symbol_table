IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR SPIKE3

Indenting tree structures according to depth can be done in many
ways.  Some possibilities include:

 - Passing an 'unsigned depth' argument around during a recursive tree
   walk.  Most node printing routines just pass it on as is, but the
   STATEMENTS rule (or something thereabouts) will pass an incremented
   value to its children.

 - Additional information could be maintained in CompilerState to
   track the current block depth, and it would be manipulated there,
   rather than via an extra argument.

 - Additional information could be maintained in whatever output
   stream abstraction the compiler is using, and be manipulated there.
